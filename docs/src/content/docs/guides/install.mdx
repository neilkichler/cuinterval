:::note
We require C++20, CMake v3.25.2+, and a recent C++ and CUDA compiler.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="CMake Project">
Integration with CMake is done in the usual ways:

<Steps>

1. Fetch the library.

   <Tabs>

   <TabItem label="CPM">
    If you use [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake), just add the following.
    ```cmake title="CMakelists.txt"
    CPMAddPackage("gh:neilkichler/cuinterval@0.2.0")
    ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="FetchContent">
    [FetchContent](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html) is built-in to recent CMake.
    Ensure once at the top of your `CMakelists.txt` you have at least version `3.14` as a requirement.
    ```cmake title="CMakelists.txt"
    cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
    ```
    And you need to include it somewhere.
    ```cmake title="CMakelists.txt"
       include(FetchContent)
    ```
    Now all dependencies can be added using [FetchContent_Declare](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#command:fetchcontent_declare)
    and [FetchContent_MakeAvailable](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FetchContent.html#command:fetchcontent_makeavailable). Here shown for `cuinterval`.
    ```cmake title="CMakelists.txt"
    FetchContent_Declare(
      cuinterval
      GIT_REPOSITORY git@github.com:neilkichler/cuinterval.git
      GIT_TAG main
    )
    FetchContent_MakeAvailable(cuinterval)
    ```

   </TabItem>

   <TabItem label="System-wide">
      A system-wide install is currently only possible by building from source.
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/neilkichler/cuinterval.git
      cd cuinterval
      cmake --preset release
      cmake --build build
      cmake --install build
      ```

      :::note
      By default we make use of Ninja for building.
      :::

      You also need to add `find_package(cuinterval)` before linking to the library.
      ```cmake title="CMakelists.txt"
      find_package(cuinterval)
      ```
   </TabItem>

   
   <TabItem label="Git submodule">
    To manage the dependency as Git submodule, you can add it as follows.

    ```bash
      git submodule add https://github.com/neilkichler/cuinterval.git
    ```

   :::note
   If you want to change things, a fork of the cuinterval library is probably your best option. Then, the submodule should link to your fork.
   :::

   Now you just need to add the subdirectory.
   ```cmake title="CMakelists.txt"
    add_subdirectory(path/to/cuinterval)
   ```
   </TabItem>

   </Tabs>

2. Add the library as a link dependency to your project.
    ```cmake title="CMakelists.txt"
    target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC cuinterval)
    ```

3. Take a look at the [example](/starlight-docs-example/guides/example) to get started.

</Steps>
  
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Header-only">
  You can directly include the [header folder](https://github.com/neilkichler/cuinterval/tree/main/include/cuinterval) into your project.
  
  The latest header-only version is available in the `header-only` branch:
  https://github.com/neilkichler/cuinterval/archive/header-only.zip
  
  :::note
  Previous versions can be found in [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/neilkichler/cuinterval/releases).

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Single Header">
  Download the latest [amalgamated single header version of the library](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neilkichler/cuinterval/refs/heads/single-header/cuinterval.cuh).
  
  ```bash
  curl -o cuinterval.cuh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/neilkichler/cuinterval/refs/heads/single-header/cuinterval.cuh
  ```
